# DNAmPredict_mutated_genes

This repository holds the R scripts used for the paper in progress to be published "A classified mixed effects model reveals that mutated genes CTNNB1 DMD XIRP2 and PIK3CA influence DNA methylation levels in cervical cancer". The repository was originally developed by Dr. J. Sunil Rao lab and can be found under https://github.com/hhhxz305/DNAmPredict
We revised the codes to use mutated genes in cervical cancer instead of Copy Number Variations (CNVs) and some other small revisions to adapt to this new study.
Files have numbers at the end that indicate the order used during our study. For instance, import_setupdata.0 is the first file followed by Gini_Gap_cancercombos.1
